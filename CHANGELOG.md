# Changelog — QUANTUM GAMMAWAVE (QG-1)

All notable changes to the firmware, the Web Studio, the emulator and the installer pages.
The device is an M-VAVE FM-1 (AC791N); no entry here was tested by flashing hardware.

## v1.6-QG — EVOLVE / MOTION, Touch & 200 Sounds (2026-11-03)

### Library — exactly 200 factory sounds
- Removed the two least distinct DRUM kits, **HEARTH KIT** and **CYBER DRUM** (the last two entries).
  DRUM keeps indices 0..9 unchanged, so every project, favorite and user preset still loads the same kit;
  an old index past the table falls back to kit 0 through the existing `preset % npresets` path.
- Added 16 original sounds (not variations): QUANTUM BLOOM, ABYSSAL DRONE, PRISM KEYS, GLASS BELL,
  AURORA PLUCK, OCEANIC PAD, EMBER LEAD (ANALOG); EVOLVING GLASS (PHASE); TAPE DRONE (LOFI);
  CATHEDRAL REED, TIDAL ORGAN (WHEEL); BREATH CHOIR (FORMANT); SOLAR WIND (NOISE);
  EVOLVE BELL, VELVET EP, AURORA FM (FM6).
- Per engine: ANALOG 56, PHASE 25, LOFI 25, FORMANT 20, WHEEL 18, DRUM 10, NOISE 17, FM6 29 = 200.
- `tests/preset_library_test.py` (run by `tests/run_tests.sh`) checks the total, each engine's share,
  DRUM's ten preserved indices, the retired names and every entry's ranges.

### EVOLVE / MOTION
- New LFO wave **EVO** (`P_LWAVE = 6`, appended to `N_LWAVE`): a smooth random walk with one new point per
  cycle, eased with an integer smoothstep. Reuses RATE, PHASE, FADE, the LFO destinations and the matrix.
- Negative RATE is already the musical division on the transport's grid (4BAR..1/32); positive RATE is the
  free rate. Both are used by the demo sounds. No new parameter, no format change.
- Demo sounds: QUANTUM BLOOM, ABYSSAL DRONE, OCEANIC PAD, EVOLVING GLASS, TAPE DRONE, SOLAR WIND,
  CATHEDRAL REED, TIDAL ORGAN, EVOLVE BELL, AURORA FM.

### Touch — velocity and aftertouch, honestly
- Channel aftertouch (MIDI `0xD0`) continues to feed `MS_AT`, per track.
- New per-voice source **PAT** (`MS_PAT`, appended): polyphonic aftertouch (MIDI `0xA0`) from an external
  controller, routed to the matching held key. The FM-1's 27 key switches have no pressure sensor, so the
  device's own keys never fake per-key pressure.
- Sensitivity and curve: the matrix AMT per destination (CUT, SHP, AMP, PITCH, VIB, E1..E8, CHO, DLY, REV,
  RATE); engines keep their own velocity response. Adding stored curve/sensitivity parameters would have
  grown `P_COUNT` and broken the frozen project layout, so it was deliberately not done.
- Presets demonstrating the routes: PRISM KEYS (VEL→CUT, AT→CUT), GLASS BELL (VEL→CUT, PAT→VIB),
  AURORA PLUCK (VEL→CUT, AT→REV), BREATH CHOIR (AT→E1 vowel), VELVET EP (VEL→CUT, AT→VIB),
  EMBER LEAD (VEL→CUT, AT→VIB).

### UI
- HOME and EDIT WAVE 1 rotary knobs redrawn as real round knobs: filled body, 270-degree ring, value arc,
  needle and centre dot; the offset orbit ring and the bakelite artefact are gone.
- Boot splash redrawn as one SURF card in the UI's language: theme rule, QG monogram with a dotted orbit,
  three waves written across it, the 16-segment rail and its playhead. The old octagonal frame's dark bands
  (read as four black lines) are gone. It is still shapes only, in the saved palette, and still written by
  the same 4 ms timeline.
- No change to the device bootloader, flash layout, or recovery code.

### Verification (see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/POLYPHONY_1.6.md`, `docs/TOUCH_1.6.md`)
- **VERIFIED on the host:** 200-sound library test; UI lint/alignment (0 findings) and PNG renders;
  golden renders and the health suite; installer, Web Studio and backup tests; sanitizer/fuzz runs when
  the local compiler supports them.
- **SIMULATED:** the emulator page and its installer strings, from the same firmware sources.
- **NOT VERIFIED:** anything on a physical FM-1; a 12-voice build on hardware; a rebuilt `felucca.wasm`
  when Emscripten is unavailable in the build environment; package signing (design only, not enabled).
